If I had a thousand lives, I would do a thousand things.
So, I guess I have a lot of passions. Feel free to browse around!

I am currently a Graduate Research Assistant performing research at Los Alamos National Laboratory.
My research interests include:

* Polymer Science
* Additive Manufacturing
* Radiation Shielding

When I'm not doing science, you can generally encounter me painting, 
playing and composing music, reading, writing, and playing sports.
